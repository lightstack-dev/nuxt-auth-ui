## Why Auth UI Matters

Building authentication sucks. You either spend weeks building forms and flows, or you get a hosted solution that costs a fortune and doesn't match your app's design.

**The typical pain points:**

- 😤 Generic auth pages that look nothing like your app
- ⏰ Hours spent styling forms, validation messages, and error states
- 🔀 Inconsistent UX between your app and authentication flows
- 🧹 Maintaining auth UI code alongside your business logic

## Our Solution

Lightstack's nuxt-auth-ui gives you complete authentication flows that feel native to your app. Built with Nuxt UI components, so it automatically matches your theme and design system.

**The result:**

- ✨ **Seamless experience** - Auth pages look and feel like part of your app
- 🎯 **Zero maintenance** - The module handles the forms, validation, and error states
- 🎨 **Theme consistency** - Automatically inherits your Nuxt UI configuration
- 🚀 **Production ready** - Built on Logto's enterprise-grade authentication

## Quick Start

::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @lightstack-dev/nuxt-auth-ui @logto/nuxt @nuxtjs/i18n
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @lightstack-dev/nuxt-auth-ui @logto/nuxt @nuxtjs/i18n
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @lightstack-dev/nuxt-auth-ui @logto/nuxt @nuxtjs/i18n
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @lightstack-dev/nuxt-auth-ui @logto/nuxt @nuxtjs/i18n
```

::

```typescript [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ["@lightstack-dev/nuxt-auth-ui", "@logto/nuxt", "@nuxtjs/i18n"],
});
```

```vue [app.vue]
<template>
  <ASignInButton />
</template>
```

## What Makes It Different

🔧 **Built for Nuxt developers** - Uses the tools you already know and love  
🎨 **Theme-aware** - Respects your existing Nuxt UI configuration  
⚡ **Lightweight** - Only adds what you actually use  
🛣️ **Flexible routing** - Configure auth routes to match your URL structure  
📝 **TypeScript first** - Fully typed for the best developer experience

## Design Philosophy

This module is **purpose-built for Logto** to provide a complete, opinionated authentication solution that gets you from idea to production quickly.

While the UI components expose methods and events for advanced customization within Logto workflows, this module is not designed to be authentication provider-agnostic. When your application grows beyond Logto's capabilities, you'll likely want to implement custom authentication UI tailored to your chosen provider.
